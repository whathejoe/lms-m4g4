                                <p>This chapter deals with time measurement , perimeter and square units of measurements. it starts with a lesson on finding elapsed time in minutes and seconds. Knowing how to read time in minutes or seconds is necessary for you to be able to find the length of time that an event occured. You will also learn to estimate elapsed time in minutes and seconds which is an essential skill in telling time.</p>
                                
                                <p>You will also learn to find the perimeter , which is the distance around a polygon , by getting the sum of all its sides and later introduce you to a shorter way of doing it . This chapter also provides you with a lesson on square units of measures. you will learn to convert one square unit of measure to another square unit of measure.</p>

                                <p>Problem solving lessons are also included as application of your knowledge and skills learned on elapsed time, perimeter and square units of measure.</p>
